# Accessing My ownCloud Server

You can access your ownCloud server from both a desktop or a mobile browser. For a list of supported browsers, see System Requirementsd

1. From your mobile or desktop, open a supported browser, and enter the following:
`http://localhost:8080/owncloud/index.ph`
1. Enter your username and password.
1. Click **Connect**.

If your ownCloud server has a self-signed SSL certificate, you will see a warning message saying that the site is not trusted. Click **Yes** at the prompt.

If you logged in from your mobile, you  will be prompted to install the ownCloud app from the Google PlayStore or from the Apple App store.

You can now access the server.
